# Linux From Scratch

I'm following the book and building a Linux distro from zero. I probably should have installed Gentoo first, since it seems to be the intermediate step between installing Arch (which I've done a couple times) and building an entire system from zero. Anyways, great opportunity to learn a bit more about Unix, Linux, GNU, etc.

LFS is a great project and I suggest anyone interested in Linux and Operating Systems to read the book (and build the OS).
